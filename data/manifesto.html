<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>This application leverages an open news API from https://newsapi.org/</br>
It's built on Python, and leverages Streamlit to deliver the web application itself.</br>
The webform below collects parameters - subject, date, and language.</br>
On submission, an API call is made, and the relevant portions of the results are returned in three columns.</p>
